# The Scenic Route to Success: A Career Journey Nobody Planned | My Story

Let me tell you something about career paths. They're messy. Nobody's actually follows the plan.

Mine? It's been all over the place. And that's completely fine.

## Act I: The Interview I Almost Slept Through

So there I was. About to interview at a boutique consulting firm. One small problem.

I was asleep.

I'd pulled an all-nighter. Woke up ten minutes before the interview. *Ten minutes.* 

Somehow I made it. Somehow I got the job. Data consultant role. They embedded me with A.T. Kearney's team (a management consulting firm). Next thing I know, I'm in Boston working on projects for Energizer and Gillette.

The takeaway? Sometimes showing up is half the battle. Even if you look like garbage.

Do I recommend this? No. Did it work? Yeah, somehow.

## Act II: Sony and the Great Engineering Exit

After consulting, I joined Sony. Then I did something weird. I stopped doing pure software engineering.

Moved into technical project management. Business analyst work. We did Blu-ray tech. Digital supply chain stuff. Real product work.

And here's what I learned: **Dealing with people is hard. Like, really hard.**

Sometimes there's no good answer. No algorithm fixes personality conflicts. No perfect spreadsheet resolves two stakeholders who just won't agree.

Code problems always have a logical explanation. People problems? They just... exist sometimes.

I got better at soft skills. Project management. Product thinking. But I also learned to be cool with ambiguity. With things not having neat solutions.

It was uncomfortable. It was necessary.

## Act III: The Startup Years

Then came three different startups. All as founding leadership team member.

The big one was Camino Financial. We grew from nothing to 200+ people. Raised hundreds of millions. It was wild.

I hired people. I fired people. That never gets easier, by the way. I used AI and machine learning. Built software. Managed teams. Navigated C-suite politics that would make a soap opera jealous.

We built teams from scratch. We survived COVID. The remote work transition. All of it.

Here's the thing about startups: You're always solving the same problems. Just bigger. With more money and more people watching.

Leadership isn't about having answers. It's about staying calm when nobody has answers. It's about building something real from nothing.

## The Point of All This

There's no "right" path. 

You don't have to stay in your lane. You don't have to climb some corporate ladder. Your career doesn't need to look good on LinkedIn. It just needs to work for you.

My path? Consulting to corporate to startup chaos. Yours will be different. That's the whole point.

Some of my best skills came from screwing up. My project management? Learned from impossible Sony deadlines. My leadership style? Equal parts startup wins and startup failures. My ability to function on no sleep? That's all 2008 me. Thanks, buddy.

## Final Thoughts

Success isn't one thing. It's not a straight line.

It's a bunch of moments where you kept going. Even when you woke up ten minutes late. Even when you pivoted away from what you knew. Even when people problems had no solutions. Even when building something felt impossible.

If your career looks messy, congrats. You're doing it right.

Just set multiple alarms though.
