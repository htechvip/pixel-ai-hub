# The 3 Traits That Make Someone Worth $200K (From a CTO Who's Hired Hundreds)

I've sat in both chairs. As a project manager at Sony, I watched consultants without technical skills struggle to compete. As a founding CTO three times, I've hired hundreds of people—and I'll tell you what made someone worth $200K vs $50K. It wasn't their degree or years of experience.

In fact, some of my best hires had unconventional backgrounds. One of them started as a junior developer making $65K. Within 18 months, I promoted him to Lead Engineer at $185K. He didn't suddenly get a master's degree or attend a coding bootcamp. He demonstrated three traits that made him irreplaceable.

These same three traits are what I look for when I'm consulting with companies through Hyperionsoft. And they're exactly what I teach my USC students to develop if they want to fast-track their careers.

Here's what actually separates someone worth $50K from someone worth $200K+.

## Trait #1: They Know When to Switch Between Team Player and Leader

Most people get stuck in one mode. They're either the person who always follows directions or the person who always needs to be in charge. Both are career limiters.

The people I've promoted fastest understood something crucial: leadership isn't about your title, it's about reading the situation and adapting.

### The Team Player Mode

At Sony, I watched a senior consultant crash and burn because he couldn't stop "leading" even when the situation required him to execute. Every meeting became a strategy session. Every task became a chance to redesign the entire process. Meanwhile, deadlines were slipping and the team was frustrated.

Compare that to Marcus, someone I hired at one of my startups. He came in as a mid-level engineer, but I noticed something unusual in his first week. During a critical product launch, he didn't argue about architecture decisions or try to prove he was the smartest person in the room. He asked: "What needs to get done today?" and then he executed flawlessly.

"I saw that we were behind schedule and the team was stressed," Marcus told me later. "That wasn't the time for me to optimize the codebase or debate technology choices. That was the time to ship working code and support my teammates."

### The Leader Mode

But here's where Marcus became invaluable. Two weeks after launch, when the immediate crisis was over, he came to me with a detailed analysis of our deployment process and a proposal for automation that would prevent future emergencies.

"I didn't bring this up during the launch because timing mattered," he explained. "But now that we have breathing room, I think we should address this systematically."

That's the switch. Marcus knew when to execute without questioning and when to step up with strategic thinking. He didn't need a title to give him permission to lead—he read the situation and adapted.

### What This Looks Like in Corporate

I've seen this trait play out across every role I've hired for or consulted on:

- The marketing coordinator who executes campaigns flawlessly when needed, but proactively identifies new market opportunities when there's strategic space
- The customer success manager who follows the playbook during busy seasons, but redesigns the onboarding process during slower periods  
- The financial analyst who produces reports on deadline, but volunteers to lead the budget automation project when bandwidth allows

### Why This Makes You Worth More

At $50K, you do what you're told when you're told.
At $100K, you execute exceptionally well without much supervision.
At $200K+, you read situations and adapt your role based on what the organization needs most at that moment.

As a CTO, I could rely on people like Marcus for anything because I knew they'd show up in whatever capacity was needed. That versatility is rare and extremely valuable.

## Trait #2: They Pick Up New Technologies on Their Own

I don't care about your current skill stack. I care about your learning velocity.

Some of the worst hires I've made were people with impressive resumes who knew ten programming languages but couldn't learn an eleventh. Some of my best hires were people who knew two languages but had taught themselves both—and showed me they could learn anything they needed.

### The PHP Core Modification Story

One of my favorite hires was Daniel, who joined one of my startups as a junior developer. His resume wasn't impressive—self-taught programmer, community college, no big-name companies. But during the interview, he mentioned he'd been frustrated with how PHP handled certain data structures, so he'd modified the PHP core components to experiment with alternative approaches.

"You modified PHP core?" I asked. "That's not exactly beginner-friendly."

"I needed to understand how it actually worked under the hood," Daniel shrugged. "I couldn't find documentation that answered my question, so I read the source code and started experimenting."

That curiosity and initiative told me everything I needed to know. I hired him on the spot.

### Why Independent Learning Matters

Within six months at my startup, we needed to integrate a machine learning component into our product. None of our existing team had ML experience. 

Most developers would say: "That's not my specialty, we should hire someone."

Daniel said: "Give me a week."

He spent evenings going through ML tutorials, weekends experimenting with models, and came back with a working prototype. It wasn't perfect, but it proved feasibility and gave us a foundation to build on.

"I didn't know ML when you asked," Daniel told me. "But I knew I could learn it. That's what I've been doing my whole career—figuring out what I don't know and teaching myself."

That's the attitude that got him promoted from $75K to $160K in two years.

### What This Looks Like Across Roles

This trait isn't just for developers. I've seen it in every function:

- The marketing person who taught themselves SQL to analyze campaign data instead of waiting for the analytics team
- The operations manager who learned Python to automate inventory tracking because IT was backlogged for six months
- The sales rep who figured out how to use AI tools to generate personalized outreach at scale

### The AI Era Makes This Even More Critical

Here's what I'm seeing now: the learning velocity gap is widening dramatically because of AI.

At USC, I teach students who range from complete beginners to experienced developers. The ones who succeed fastest aren't necessarily the ones with the strongest technical foundations—they're the ones who experiment with AI tools without waiting for permission or perfect knowledge.

I watch some students spend weeks reading documentation before trying anything. Meanwhile, other students are building functional prototypes in days by using ChatGPT to fill knowledge gaps and experimenting rapidly.

The fast learners don't have impostor syndrome about what they don't know. They're comfortable being uncomfortable and figuring things out.

### Why This Makes You Worth More

At $50K, you know your current job description.
At $100K, you're excellent at what you already know.
At $200K+, you can acquire new capabilities faster than the company can hire for them.

When I'm evaluating someone for promotion or a raise, I ask: "If the business needs change, can this person adapt?" The independent learners always get a yes. They're not just executing today's job—they're positioning themselves for tomorrow's needs.

## Trait #3: The Right Attitude (This Trumps Everything)

I've fired people with genius-level IQs and promoted people with average intelligence. The difference? Attitude.

Technical skills can be taught. Strategic thinking can be developed. But attitude—curiosity, humility, ownership, resilience—that's either there or it isn't.

### What the Right Attitude Actually Looks Like

Let me tell you about two people I hired at different startups, both at similar skill levels.

**Candidate A** came from a top university, had worked at big tech companies, and interviewed brilliantly. On paper, he was my strongest hire ever.

Three months in, I regretted the decision. When code reviews highlighted issues, he got defensive. When users reported bugs in his features, he blamed the QA team. When I asked him to work with the product team on a new feature, he said: "That's not really my area, you should have someone else do it."

He had the skills but completely lacked ownership mentality.

**Candidate B** came from a non-traditional background and had less impressive credentials. But during the interview, when I described a challenging technical problem we were facing, he got excited.

"I don't know how to solve that yet," he said, "but I'd love to figure it out."

That response told me everything. He saw challenges as interesting problems, not obstacles to avoid.

Six months later, Candidate A was gone (mutual decision). Candidate B became one of my most valuable team members and eventually got promoted to engineering manager.

### The Attitude Markers I Look For

**1. Curiosity Over Defensiveness**

When someone points out an issue with your work, do you:
- Get defensive and explain why it's actually fine? (Wrong attitude)
- Say "interesting, let me look at that" and actually investigate? (Right attitude)

**2. Ownership Over Blame**

When something goes wrong, do you:
- Immediately identify who else was responsible? (Wrong attitude)  
- Ask "what could I have done differently?" (Right attitude)

**3. Experimentation Over Perfection**

When facing something new, do you:
- Wait until you understand everything before trying? (Wrong attitude)
- Start experimenting and learn by doing? (Right attitude)

**4. Contribution Over Credit**

When the team succeeds, do you:
- Make sure everyone knows your specific contributions? (Wrong attitude)
- Feel satisfied the team won, regardless of individual attribution? (Right attitude)

### The Ricoh Experience

When I was at Ricoh, I saw this play out repeatedly. The company was going through a major digital transformation, and everyone was being asked to learn new systems and processes.

Some employees with 15+ years at the company resisted: "This isn't how we've always done things" or "I'm too old to learn new systems."

Others, regardless of age or tenure, jumped in: "This is different, but let me figure it out."

Guess who got selected for the transformation leadership team? It wasn't based on seniority or current role—it was entirely based on attitude toward change.

### Why Attitude Trumps Everything

Here's what I learned hiring hundreds of people: I can teach someone technical skills. I can mentor someone on strategy. I can provide resources for learning.

What I can't fix is someone who:
- Doesn't take ownership when things go wrong
- Gets defensive when receiving feedback  
- Avoids challenges outside their comfort zone
- Needs external motivation to give their best effort

### The AI Parallel

At USC, I see this attitude difference play out with AI adoption. I have students with strong coding backgrounds who are skeptical of AI tools: "I'd rather write code myself" or "AI-generated code isn't as good as what I can write."

Then I have students with weaker technical foundations who embrace AI: "I don't fully understand this yet, but let me see what AI can help me build."

By the end of the semester, the students with the right attitude have built more impressive projects because they were willing to leverage tools and learn, rather than protecting their ego about what they already knew.

### Why This Makes You Worth More

At $50K, you do your job adequately.
At $100K, you do your job excellently.
At $200K+, you make everyone around you better because your attitude elevates the entire team.

When I'm deciding between promoting someone internally or hiring externally, attitude is the tiebreaker. I'll take someone with 80% of the skills and 100% the right attitude over someone with 100% skills and 80% attitude every single time.

## How These Three Traits Work Together

Here's what makes someone truly exceptional: when all three traits compound.

Marcus (team player/leader flexibility) also had the right attitude, which made him coachable and willing to step up. Daniel (independent learner) could switch between executing and leading, which made his learning immediately applicable to business needs.

The most valuable people I've ever worked with—the ones I promoted fastest and paid the most—had all three traits:

1. **They adapted their role** based on what the situation needed
2. **They learned new capabilities** faster than the organization could hire for them  
3. **They had the attitude** that made them easy to work with and impossible to replace

### The $200K+ Formula

Role flexibility + Learning velocity + Right attitude = Exponential career growth

I've seen this formula play out across Sony, Ricoh, McKinsey, and three startups I've built. The pattern is consistent across industries, company sizes, and roles.

## What This Means for Your Career

If you're reading this and thinking "I don't have all three traits yet," good. That self-awareness is part of the right attitude.

These traits are developable. I've watched people grow into them.

**Start with attitude** (easiest to change immediately):
- Next time you get feedback, respond with curiosity instead of defensiveness
- Next time something goes wrong, ask what you could have done differently
- Next time you face something unfamiliar, experiment instead of waiting for perfect knowledge

**Build learning velocity** (medium difficulty):
- Pick one AI tool relevant to your role and force yourself to use it for a week
- When you hit a knowledge gap, teach yourself instead of waiting for training
- Document what you learn so others benefit

**Develop role flexibility** (hardest but most valuable):
- Notice when your team needs execution vs strategy
- Practice contributing without needing credit or title permission
- Volunteer for responsibilities outside your job description when you have capacity

## The Bottom Line

I've been on both sides of the hiring and promotion table. At Sony and McKinsey, I saw who got promoted and why. As a founding CTO three times, I made the promotion and compensation decisions myself.

The people who went from $50K to $200K+ weren't the ones with the best credentials or most experience. They were the ones who:
- **Flexed between team player and leader** based on what was needed
- **Learned new capabilities independently** faster than the company could hire for them
- **Had the attitude** that made them valuable beyond their current skill set

If you have these three traits, you don't need to wait for your company to recognize them. Start using them today, and the recognition will follow.

And if you don't have them yet? Start building them. Because these traits are exactly what companies are desperately seeking in the AI era—and exactly what they're willing to pay $200K+ to get.
