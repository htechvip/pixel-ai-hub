# What I Learned About Hiring at a Startup  

I never look for Ivy League all-star pedigree.  
I never cared much about GPA either.  

When I was building the team at **Camino Financial**, I had to learn fast.  
We were small.  
We were scrappy.  
And every hire could either push us forward or slow us down.  

I didn’t need “perfect on paper” people.  
I needed self-starters.  
I needed people who were curious and willing to learn new technologies.  
I loved it when someone had a tech side project.  
It showed me they didn’t just *talk* about building.  
They actually built.

## The First Few Hires  

I still remember my first few hires at Camino.  
We couldn’t compete with big tech salaries.  
So I had to find people who wanted something more than a paycheck.  

One candidate walked in with no fancy degree.  
No big-name company on their resume.  
But they had built a small mobile app in their free time.  
It wasn’t polished.  
But it worked.  

That impressed me more than any GPA.  
Because I knew if they could build something alone, they could build with us.  
I hired them.  
They turned out to be one of the most dependable people on the team.

## When Replacements Were Necessary  

Of course, not everyone worked out.  
I once hired someone who looked great on paper.  
Strong resume.  
Solid skills.  
But after a few weeks, it was clear they weren’t motivated.  
They waited for instructions.  
They didn’t take initiative.  

That killed momentum.  
And in a startup, momentum is everything.  

Letting someone go is never easy.  
But I learned that waiting too long makes it worse.  
When I replaced them, the team’s energy instantly lifted.  
Everyone felt the difference.

## The Senior Hire That Backfired  

Hiring senior people was a different challenge.  
On one hand, you want experience.  
On the other, you risk ego.
