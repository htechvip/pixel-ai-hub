# What I Learned About Hiring at a Startup  

I never look for Ivy League all-star pedigree.  
I never cared much about GPA either.  

When I was building the team at **Camino Financial**, I had to learn fast.  
We were small.  
We were scrappy.  
And every hire could either push us forward or slow us down.  

I didn’t need “perfect on paper” people.  
I needed self-starters.  
I needed people who were curious and willing to learn new technologies.  
I loved it when someone had a tech side project.  
It showed me they didn’t just *talk* about building.  
They actually built.

## The First Few Hires  

I still remember my first few hires at Camino.  
We couldn’t compete with big tech salaries.  
So I had to find people who wanted something more than a paycheck.  

One candidate walked in with no fancy degree.  
No big-name company on their resume.  
But they had built a small mobile app in their free time.  
It wasn’t polished.  
But it worked.  

That impressed me more than any GPA.  
Because I knew if they could build something alone, they could build with us.  
I hired them.  
They turned out to be one of the most dependable people on the team.

## When Replacements Were Necessary  

Of course, not everyone worked out.  
I once hired someone who looked great on paper.  
Strong resume.  
Solid skills.  
But after a few weeks, it was clear they weren’t motivated.  
They waited for instructions.  
They didn’t take initiative.  

That killed momentum.  
And in a startup, momentum is everything.  

Letting someone go is never easy.  
But I learned that waiting too long makes it worse.  
When I replaced them, the team’s energy instantly lifted.  
Everyone felt the difference.

## The Senior Hire That Backfired  

Hiring senior people was a different challenge.  
On one hand, you want experience.  
On the other, you risk ego.  

I remember bringing in a senior engineer.  
They had been at a large tech company.  
They knew their stuff.  
But from day one, they resisted how we worked.  
They wanted rigid processes.  
They wanted control.  
And they looked down on the junior team members.  

That didn’t sit well with me.  
Or with the team.  

A startup requires humility.  
You can’t say, “That’s not my job.”  
You have to do what needs to be done — no matter your title.  
This senior hire couldn’t adapt.  
Eventually, we had to part ways.  

That experience taught me something big:  
seniority doesn’t equal fit.

## The Myth of the 10x Engineer  

I also came across “10x engineers.”  
You know the type.  
Brilliant.  
Lightning fast.  
Can code circles around everyone else.  

At first, I thought we had found gold.  
This person could build features in half the time.  
They solved complex problems with ease.  

But there was a catch.  
They didn’t like working with others.  
They dismissed teammates’ ideas.  
They made the rest of the team feel small.  

Pretty soon, collaboration broke down.  
Morale dropped.  
People dreaded meetings.  

I realized something important.  
A real 10x engineer isn’t the fastest coder.  
A real 10x engineer makes *everyone else* more productive.  
The “brilliant loner” type was toxic.  
We had to move on.

## The Joy of the Self-Starter  

But then there were the wins.  
One of my favorite hires was a junior developer.  
They had only one internship under their belt.  
But when I asked about side projects, their eyes lit up.  
They had been building a web app to help their family’s small business.  

They weren’t just coding for fun.  
They were solving real problems.  

That told me everything I needed to know.  
I hired them.  
They worked harder than anyone.  
They learned fast.  
And they became a core part of the team.  

That’s the kind of person I wanted at Camino.

## Expanding the Team  

As Camino grew, I had to expand the team quickly.  
That was stressful.  
Sometimes I needed to fill a role yesterday.  
The temptation was to rush.  

I learned the hard way that rushing leads to mistakes.  
One rushed hire set us back months.  
They weren’t aligned with our mission.  
They didn’t share our values.  
And it created constant friction.  

After that, I slowed down.  
Even under pressure, I asked myself:  
“Does this person have the right mindset?  
Will they make the team better?  
Do they believe in what we’re building?”  

If the answer was no, I passed.

## Lessons From the Journey  

Looking back, my hiring journey at Camino taught me a few simple truths:  

- Side projects matter more than pedigrees.  
- Self-starters beat resume stars.  
- Replace quickly when it’s not working.  
- Seniority is useless without humility.  
- A true 10x engineer makes the *team* better, not just themselves.  
- Culture fit beats raw skill every time.

## Final Reflection  

Hiring at a startup is one of the hardest parts of the job.  
It’s also one of the most rewarding.  

When you get it right, you feel it instantly.  
The team clicks.  
The energy is contagious.  
People push each other to do their best work.  

When you get it wrong, you feel that too.  
The air gets heavy.  
Projects stall.  
People stop enjoying the work.  

At Camino Financial, I learned that the right hires don’t just build code or write documents.  
They build culture.  
They build momentum.  
And they build trust.  

That’s what makes a startup thrive.  
Not Ivy League resumes.  
Not perfect GPAs.  
But people who are hungry to learn, eager to build, and humble enough to grow with the team.  

That’s who I looked for.  
And that’s who made all the difference.
