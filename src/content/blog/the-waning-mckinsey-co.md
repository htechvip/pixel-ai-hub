# The Waning McKinsey & Co.

**New York, 2000**

The elevator ascended with the hushed confidence of money—lots of it. I watched the floor numbers climb, my reflection fragmenting across polished brass. Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine. The McKinsey & Company offices occupied the top floors, and everything about the building seemed designed to remind you that you were rising toward rarified air.

At twenty-two, I had somehow landed here. When the McKinsey offer came, my parents wept with pride over a crackling international call home. Their son, welcomed into the temple of American business excellence.

The reception area gleamed. Chrome and glass caught the Manhattan skyline, suspended it like a promise. I met them all those first weeks—brilliant minds from Harvard, Oxford, Stanford. The partners moved through the office with an authority that seemed almost priestly. They spoke in frameworks: two-by-two matrices, value chains, Porter's Five Forces. Every business problem became a puzzle they could elegantly solve.

"You'll love the research," my mentor Patricia told me, a sharp-eyed partner who'd built her career on healthcare transformations. "We have access to everything. Every case study, every industry report. You're joining an institution with seventy years of knowledge."

I dove in. The firm's legendary archives became my world. I absorbed case studies like sacred texts, each one a masterpiece of analysis decorated with elegant slides and confident recommendations. The steel company turnaround from 1987. The retail transformation from 1998. The dot-com strategy from just last year. I was drinking from a firehose of business wisdom, and it felt intoxicating.

The consultants I shadowed moved with purpose and precision. They could walk into a boardroom and within minutes establish themselves as the smartest people there. They wielded data like weapons, turned chaos into clear narratives, made complex decisions seem obvious in retrospect.

Then came the offsite.

Some client had arranged a retreat at a resort upstate—one of those places where the towels were thicker than most people's blankets and the conference rooms had better views than most apartments. I wasn't directly involved, but they brought me along to observe, to learn, to absorb how the magic happened.

For two days, I watched presentations and strategy sessions. The senior partners commanded the rooms effortlessly, their insights landing with the weight of revelation. Everything felt important, transformative, worth every dollar of the astronomical fees.

On the second evening, I found myself near the bar when two senior partners settled into nearby armchairs, bourbon in hand. They didn't notice me, or didn't care. Their voices carried in that way voices do when expensive alcohol loosens tongues.

"Great engagement," one said. "Client's thrilled."

"They always are at this stage," the other replied with a chuckle. "Wait until they try to actually implement any of it."

"Not our problem."

"Never is."

They laughed—not cruelly, just matter-of-factly. Like mechanics discussing a car they'd diagnosed but had no intention of fixing.

I felt something crack inside me.

The conversation moved on to other topics—billing rates, potential new clients, office politics—but I couldn't shake those few sentences. *Not our problem. Never is.* Said with the casual confidence of people who'd built entire careers on a model where results were always someone else's responsibility.

Then came Kuala Lumpur.

The Petronas Twin Towers pierced the Malaysian sky like silver needles. The McKinsey office occupied several floors in Tower Two, and I remember standing at the window on my first morning there, looking across at its identical twin, feeling like I'd entered some gleaming future. The consultants here moved with the same confidence as their New York counterparts, spoke the same language of transformation and value creation.

I met partners who'd worked on infrastructure projects across Southeast Asia, digital transformations for regional banks, supply chain overhauls for manufacturing giants. Every conversation was peppered with impressive results, transformed companies, industries reshaped.

But now I was listening differently. I heard what they emphasized—the analysis, the insights, the strategic frameworks—and what they glossed over. Implementation was always described in passive voice, as something that "happened" or "was undertaken" after McKinsey departed. Success was measured in deliverables produced, not outcomes achieved.

One evening, sitting in a coffee shop near the towers, I pulled up some of the case studies I'd been reading with such reverence. I started looking for a different pattern. What happened after McKinsey left? How many of those brilliant recommendations actually got implemented? What percentage of promised transformations actually transformed anything?

The answers were harder to find than the case studies themselves.

Back in New York, I couldn't unsee it anymore. We were in the business of expensive advice, beautifully packaged and confidently delivered, with no accountability for whether anyone actually followed it. The entire model was built on a convenient separation: we'll tell you what time it is, but don't ask us to build the clock, fix the clock, or stick around to make sure the clock keeps working.

There was an old joke making the rounds: McKinsey consultants borrow your watch to tell you the time, then keep the watch. Everyone laughed. But the more I sat in meetings and read case studies and watched partners network, the more I realized the joke was understating the problem.

We didn't just borrow their watch. We borrowed their watch, told them what time it was, charged them a fortune for the service, and walked away before they could ask why they'd needed us to read their own watch in the first place.

"This bothers you," Patricia observed one afternoon, catching the expression on my face during a team meeting.

"We don't implement," I said.

"We're strategy consultants," she replied with patient firmness. "Implementation is a different skill set. We're here to think, not to execute."

But thinking without doing felt increasingly like fortune telling. Predictions with no consequences. Prophecies we'd never have to prove.

I left after a few months. The prestige wasn't worth the growing sense that I was participating in something fundamentally hollow.

**Present Day, 2025**

The news alert flashed across my phone this morning: "McKinsey Announces 10% Workforce Reduction." Five thousand consultants, the article said. Five thousand jobs disappearing from the consulting giant that had once seemed unsinkable.

I read the analysis with a strange mixture of vindication and sadness. AI agents, the experts explained, could now do in minutes what took consultants weeks. Upload your company data, describe your challenge, and sophisticated algorithms would analyze patterns, benchmark against thousands of companies, generate strategic recommendations. No flights to New York. No million-dollar fees. No elegant consultants in expensive suits.

Five thousand people. I tried to picture it—conference rooms emptying out, offices being cleared, brilliant minds who'd beaten impossible odds to get through those doors now updating their LinkedIn profiles. Some of them probably believed in the work, believed they were genuinely helping companies transform. Maybe they never overheard that conversation at the bar.

The irony was almost poetic. The firm had spent decades perfecting the art of diagnosis while building a business model that explicitly avoided the cure. And now they were being replaced by something even better at diagnosis, even more detached from implementation.

Technology hadn't solved the fundamental problem. It had just made it cheaper and faster to not solve it.

I thought about those two partners at the resort, laughing over bourbon about implementation not being their problem. I wondered where they were now—twenty-five years later—whether they'd retired rich, whether they saw this coming, whether they understood that they'd built an empire on a foundation that was always destined to be automated away.

You can't defend a moat when your entire value proposition is pattern matching and insight generation. That's what machines were always going to be better at than humans.

The tragedy wasn't just that McKinsey was trimming 10% of its workforce. The tragedy was that nothing had fundamentally changed. Businesses would still pay for analysis. AI would still provide recommendations. And somewhere, someone would still be left holding the implementation problem, wondering why the brilliant strategy never quite worked out.

Twenty-five years ago, I'd stood in that gleaming office at the turn of the millennium, young and uncertain, sensing something was profoundly wrong. The marble floors, the Manhattan views, the aura of unassailable prestige—all of it built on a business model with a fatal flaw at its core. A flaw everyone politely agreed not to mention.

Now the market had finally caught up to what I'd felt in my gut at twenty-two.

The emperor had no clothes. It just took a quarter century, an AI revolution, and five thousand job cuts for everyone else to notice.

I closed my phone and stared out my window. Somewhere in New York, in Kuala Lumpur, in offices around the world, consultants were probably sitting in gleaming conference rooms right now, presenting brilliant analyses to clients who would nod appreciatively and then struggle to implement any of it.

The oracle had been replaced, but the addiction to prophecy remained.

And the watches? They were still being borrowed. Just by different hands now—hands made of code instead of flesh, but no more capable of actually building anything that worked.
