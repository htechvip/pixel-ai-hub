# I Just Fired Myself (And Set People Free)

There's a conversation I had last Tuesday that I keep replaying.

My mentee Solomon asked me: "How are you getting so much done lately?"

I paused.

Should I tell him?

"I'm using automation agents," I finally said. "They handle about half my routine work now."

He looked confused. "Like... bots? Don't you need to code for that?"

"Not anymore."

.
.
.

Here's what I showed Solomon.

I opened up one of the new automation platforms. The interface was dead simple.

Just a text box asking: "What do you want to automate?"

"Watch this," I said. "I'm going to automate something I do every morning."

I typed: "Check my email for customer support requests and flag urgent ones."

The platform thought for a moment. Then it asked me a few clarifying questions.

Where's your email? What counts as urgent? Where should I send the flags?

I answered in plain English.

Two minutes later, it was running.

Solomon's jaw dropped. "That's it? No coding?"

"That's it."

.
.
.

I could see the wheels turning in his head.

"So... anyone could do this?"

"Pretty much. That's the crazy part."

He went quiet. Then: "Show me more."

.
.
.

Over the next few weeks, I taught Solomon what I'd learned.

How to break down his work into automatable chunks.

How to communicate with these agents in plain language.

How to think about workflows instead of tasks.

He started simple. Automated his daily report generation. Then his data collection. Then his analysis prep work.

Within a month, he'd freed up about 10 hours a week.

"This is insane," he told me. "Why isn't everyone doing this?"

"Most people don't know it's possible yet. They think automation still requires a CS degree."

"Someone should teach them."

I smiled. "That's exactly what I've been thinking."

.
.
.

Here's what I realized:

This technology just removed a massive barrier.

For years, if you wanted to automate something, you needed:
- Programming skills
- Weeks or months of development
- Technical support

Now?

You describe what you want. The agent builds it.

That's not an incremental improvement.

That's a fundamental shift.

.
.
.

I started documenting everything I learned.

Created tutorials. Wrote guides. Made videos.

Not fancy stuff. Just clear explanations of how this actually works.

Solomon helped. Started teaching his friends. They taught their colleagues.

The knowledge spread faster than I expected.

**And here's what I noticed:**

The people learning this weren't tech experts.

They were:
- Marketing managers automating campaign reports
- HR professionals streamlining onboarding workflows  
- Small business owners handling data entry
- Freelancers managing client communications

None of them could code.

All of them deployed automation that would have been impossible for them six months ago.

.
.
.

People keep asking me: "But isn't this going to replace jobs?"

Maybe.

But here's the thing:

The technology is here regardless.

The only question is who gets to use it.

If only big companies and tech experts have access, then yeahâ€”jobs disappear and power concentrates.

But if regular people can use these tools?

Then the solo freelancer becomes as productive as a small team.

The small team competes with enterprise departments.

The average worker becomes 10x more valuable.

**It's not about humans vs. machines. It's about which humans get access to the machines.**

.
.
.

Solomon came to me last week with an interesting observation.

"I've been tracking my output," he said. "I'm doing the same amount of work as before, but it takes me half the time."

"So what are you doing with the extra time?"

"Learning new skills. Taking on better projects. Actually thinking instead of just processing."

That's the part most people miss.

Automation doesn't just save time.

It frees you to do work that actually matters.

The repetitive stuff? Let the agents handle it.

The strategic thinking? The creative problem-solving? The human relationships?

That's where you add value now.

.
.
.

Here's what this actually means for you:

Those repetitive tasks eating your day? You can automate them now.

That analysis that takes hours? An agent can handle it.

That workflow you've been managing manually? There's a solution.

And you don't need to learn Python or hire a developer.

You just need to clearly describe what you want done.

**The technical barriers are gone.**

.
.
.

I'm not saying this is easy.

You still need to:
- Understand your workflows well enough to explain them
- Learn how to communicate with these systems
- Test and refine your automations
- Think critically about what should and shouldn't be automated

But those are learnable skills.

Not technical skills. Thinking skills.

And if you've been doing your job for a while, you probably already have them.

.
.
.

Solomon asked me yesterday: "Do you think this will keep getting easier?"

"The tools? Absolutely. They're improving every month."

"So what's the advantage of learning this now?"

"You get a head start. While everyone else is still figuring out if this is real, you're already building systems. By the time it becomes mainstream, you'll be years ahead."

He nodded. "Like learning email marketing in 2010."

"Exactly like that."

.
.
.

Here's my challenge to you:

Pick one repetitive task you do regularly.

Just one.

Find an automation platform and try to automate it.

You'll probably fail the first time. That's fine.

Try again. Refine it. Make it work.

Once you get that first automation running, something clicks.

You start seeing automation opportunities everywhere.

**That's when things get interesting.**

.
.
.

I started this just trying to save myself some time.

Now I'm watching people I've taught automate workflows I never even thought of.

Solomon's building systems I don't fully understand.

The knowledge is multiplying.

And we're just scratching the surface.

**This isn't the future. It's happening right now.**

The people who figure this out early won't just survive the automation wave.

They'll ride it.

The question is: are you watching from the sidelines, or are you building?

Because the tools are here.

The barriers are down.

What's stopping you?

Stay curious,
